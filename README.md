# SWUCounter

This React app allows you to track your Star Wars: Unlimited games on any platform. At the moment, it offers the following features:

* Player Names
* Base Color and Type
* A means of tracking HP
* A way to keep track of Epic Actions on bases and leaders
* Hp and Deploy reset
* Easily start a new game

At the moment, this app only tracks two-player games, but I do plan on adding support for the four-player Twin Suns format in future versions. 

May the Force be with you!
